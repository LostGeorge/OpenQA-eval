{"question": "Hey, why did you decide to go to Stanford?", "answer": ["I wanted to just better explore the different subfields of AI more, from mostly a deep technical perspective in research labs but also the various resulting applications.", "I had been working in ML for healthcare in the digital pathology space, and felt like I wanted to have at least a few more years of exploratory freedom in academia on those topics.", "I felt like Stanford offered the best in terms of cutting-edge machine learning research and networking opportunities, particularly in computer vision and healthcare imaging."], "prediction": "Attending Stanford's Computer Science program allows me to be at the forefront of the technological revolution and collaborate with the best minds in computation. Plus, the opportunity to develop expertise in AI and build lifelong connections with research leaders is too good to pass up."}
{"question": "What do you want to do after graduation?", "answer": ["In the long run, I envision myself as a core team member for a relatively mature startup. One that's making true measurable improvements in healthcare through novel ML techniques.", "My post-graduation plans aren't really set in stone, but rejoining healthcare AI but with greater experience and understanding wouldn't be a bad option.", "With more exposure to different subfields of AI, I hope to join a fast-paced firm and work on a truly meaningful machine learning application. I donâ€™t see myself starting my own company though."], "prediction": "After graduation, I aim to contribute to the field of artificial intelligence by working on cutting-edge research projects and collaborating with industry leaders. I want to help transform the world through computing and make a meaningful impact in advancing technological innovation."}
{"question": "What do you like to do in your free time?", "answer": ["My hobbies include reading---I tend to like economics or sociology nonfiction along with scifi---and I also like board games.", "I have interests that range from philosophy to political science, so I spend quite some time reading things there, but I also like tennis and video games.", "I really enjoy euro-style board games, vising cafes, and running. The latter of which I definitely wish I did more."], "prediction": "In my free time, I enjoy exploring new coffee shops, reading books on various subjects, and having engaging discussions with friends."}
