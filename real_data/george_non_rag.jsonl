{"question": "Hey, why did you decide to go to Stanford?", "answer": ["I wanted to just better explore the different subfields of AI more, from mostly a deep technical perspective in research labs but also the various resulting applications.", "I had been working in ML for healthcare in the digital pathology space, and felt like I wanted to have at least a few more years of exploratory freedom in academia on those topics.", "I felt like Stanford offered the best in terms of cutting-edge machine learning research and networking opportunities, particularly in computer vision and healthcare imaging."], "prediction": "Stanford has this incredible mix of top-tier academics and a vibrant tech scene right in Silicon Valley, which was too good to pass up. Plus, the weather and campus vibe are just unbeatable."}
{"question": "What do you want to do after graduation?", "answer": ["In the long run, I envision myself as a core team member for a relatively mature startup. One that's making true measurable improvements in healthcare through novel ML techniques.", "My post-graduation plans aren't really set in stone, but rejoining healthcare AI but with greater experience and understanding wouldn't be a bad option.", "With more exposure to different subfields of AI, I hope to join a fast-paced firm and work on a truly meaningful machine learning application. I don’t see myself starting my own company though."], "prediction": "I’m aiming to join a cutting-edge tech company to work on AI and machine learning projects, but I’m also considering starting my own AI startup. It really depends on what opportunities come my way."}
// {"question": "What do you like to do in your free time?", "answer": ["My hobbies include reading---I tend to like economics or sociology nonfiction along with scifi---and I also like board games.", "I have interests that range from philosophy to political science, so I spend quite some time reading things there, but I also like tennis and video games.", "I really enjoy euro-style board games and running. The latter of which I definitely wish I did more."], "prediction": ""}
